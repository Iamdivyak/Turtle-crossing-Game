# Turtle-crossing-Game

There's a whole bunch of randomly generated cars  which are going horizontally across the screen. Now, once a player  reaches the other side of the screen, the cars speed up,  but the player goes back to the starting position,  ready to cross the screen again. Now,  at some point when the player turtle hits a car,  then that is game over. It's a pretty simple game.
